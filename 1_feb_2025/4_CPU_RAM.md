# üéÆ What Happens in CPU and RAM When Playing FIFA?

## üñ• RAM's Role (Memory Management)
### **What Happens in RAM?**  
‚úÖ **Game assets (textures, stadium, players, crowd, etc.) load into RAM.**  
‚úÖ **Background processes (OS, Discord, Chrome, etc.) also use RAM.**  
‚úÖ If **RAM is low**, then:
   - **Game stutters or lags (frame drops).**  
   - **Longer loading times** (assets keep loading from HDD/SSD).  
   - **Game might crash** if RAM is too low.  
   - **Windows starts using page file (virtual memory), slowing down the system.**  

### **RAM Usage (Approximate for FIFA Games)**
| **FIFA Version** | **Minimum RAM** | **Recommended RAM** | **High Settings** |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| FIFA 21       | 8GB                 | 16GB            | 16GB+          |
| FIFA 22       | 8GB                 | 16GB            | 16GB+          |
| FIFA 23       | 8GB                 | 16GB            | 16GB+          |
| EA SPORTS FC 24 | 8GB                 | 16GB            | 16GB+          |

## ‚öôÔ∏è CPU's Role (Processing & Physics Engine)
### **What Happens in CPU?**  
‚úÖ **Handles AI calculations (player movement, ball physics, opponent strategies).**  
‚úÖ **Processes multiplayer network data.**  
‚úÖ If **CPU cores are low**, then:
   - **FPS drops occur, especially in replays & crowded stadiums.**  
   - **CPU usage reaches 100%, slowing down background apps.**  
   - **Multiplayer input lag might happen.**  
   - **Cutscenes and replays could feel sluggish.**  

### **CPU Usage (Approximate for FIFA Games)**
| **FIFA Version** | **Minimum CPU** | **Recommended CPU** | **Best Performance** |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| FIFA 21       | Intel Core i3-6100  | i5-9600K       | i7 / Ryzen 7+  |
| FIFA 22       | Intel Core i3-6100  | i5-9600K       | i7 / Ryzen 7+  |
| FIFA 23       | Intel Core i5-6600K | i7-6700        | i7-9700K+ / Ryzen 7  |
| EA SPORTS FC 24 | Intel Core i5-6600K | i7-6700        | i7-9700K+ / Ryzen 7  |

## üöÄ Summary: What Happens When You Play FIFA?
| **Condition** | **If RAM is Low** | **If CPU Cores are Low** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Game Start** | Slow loading or crash. | Game launches but may lag or have FPS drops. |
| **Gameplay** | Stuttering, lag, or crashes. | Slow player movement, FPS drops. |
| **Multiplayer** | Increased network lag. | Opponent movements feel delayed. |
| **Replays/Cutscenes** | Lag or long loading delays. | Feels like slow motion due to CPU limits. |

## üõ† Solutions:
- **If RAM is below 8GB**, upgrade to at least **16GB**.
- **If CPU is i3**, upgrade to **i5/i7** or Ryzen for better performance.
- **Close background apps (Chrome, Discord, etc.) before playing.**
- **Reduce graphics settings to Medium/Low** if CPU or RAM is limiting performance.


Key Difference:
Kam RAM hone se applications crash ya freeze ho sakti hain.

Kam CPU cores hone se processing aur execution slow ho jayega, lekin crash hone ke chances kam hain

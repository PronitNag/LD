# Css has special power to add things to multiple object?

A- CSS has a special ability to apply styles to multiple objects (HTML elements) at once without looping through each element manually, as we would have to do in JavaScript

# if the DOM is a tree then how getElementsByClassName("") returns a array like data which we can loop?

A- It’s loopable but doesn’t have full array methods.<br/>
To use full array functions, convert it with **Array.from()**

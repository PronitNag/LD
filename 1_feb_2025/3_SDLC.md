# **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in an E-commerce Site using Spring Microservices**

## **1. What is SDLC?**
The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process for planning, developing, testing, and deploying software applications efficiently. It consists of **six major phases**:

1. **Planning**
2. **Requirement Analysis**
3. **Design**
4. **Development**
5. **Testing**
6. **Deployment & Maintenance**

## **2. SDLC for an E-commerce Site using Spring Boot Microservices**
Let's assume we are building an **E-commerce website** where users can **browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders**. We'll use **Spring Boot Microservices** architecture and explore the technologies used at each SDLC phase.

- **Slack / Teams** (Communication)
- **GitHub Discussions** (Collaboration & Feedback)

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Design Phase** üé®
### **Objective:**

#### **Development Tools:**
- **Git & GitHub / GitLab** (Version Control)
- **Postman** (API Testing)
- **Docker** (Containerization)
- **Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS)** (Server Setup & Management)

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Phase** üß™
### **Objective:**
- Ensure code quality, performance, and security.
- Perform unit, integration, and load testing.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **JUnit, Mockito** (Unit Testing in Spring Boot)
- **Selenium, Cypress** (Frontend Testing)
- **Postman / Newman** (API Testing)
- **JMeter / Gatling** (Performance Testing)
- **SonarQube** (Code Quality & Security Scanning)

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Maintenance Phase** üöÄ
### **Objective:**
- Deploy microservices to production.
- Monitor and maintain system health.

### **Technologies Used:**
#### **Deployment:**
- **Docker & Kubernetes** (Containerization & Orchestration)
- **AWS / Azure / Google Cloud** (Cloud Deployment)
- **Terraform / Ansible** (Infrastructure as Code)

#### **Monitoring & Logging:**
- **Prometheus & Grafana** (Monitoring)
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** (Logging)
- **Datadog / New Relic** (Performance Monitoring)

#### **CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment):**
- **Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI/CD** (Automated Deployments)

## **Final Thoughts üí°**
Understanding **SDLC** is essential for building scalable applications. For an **E-commerce site using Spring Microservices**, we follow a structured process from **planning to deployment** while using various technologies for **development, testing, and deployment**.

# How does planing happen before requirement?

# Planning vs. Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Great question! In reality, Planning and Requirement Analysis often happen together, but Planning typically comes first in the SDLC model. Here's why:

## Why Planning Happens First?
Before gathering detailed requirements, the team needs a high-level idea of the project:

- What is the purpose of the software?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What is the estimated budget and timeline?
- What resources (team members, tools, technologies) are needed?

This helps in allocating resources and defining the project scope before diving into detailed requirements.

## A More Realistic Flow
Since projects are rarely linear, a better breakdown would be:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initial Planning**: Define the business idea and rough scope.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Requirement Analysis**: Gather detailed functional & technical needs.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Revised Planning**: Adjust scope based on requirements.  

## For an E-commerce Site Example

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Planning:
- "We are building an e-commerce site with microservices."
- "It should have authentication, product listing, a shopping cart, and payments."
- "Spring Boot + React + MySQL + AWS will be our tech stack."

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Requirement Analysis:
- Define user roles (Admin, Customer, Seller).
- Decide features (Product Search, Reviews, Payment Methods).
- API design: `/products`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, etc.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Revised Planning:
- Adjust the timeline based on detailed requirements.
- Increase budget if complex features are needed.
